### Arrays
* Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

` String[] cars = {"BMW", "Audi", "Volvo", "Hyundai"}; `

#### Multi Dimensional Arrays
* Multi dimensional array is an array of arrays.
* They are useful when you want to store data as a tubular form, like a table with row and column.

` int[][] numbers = {{1,2,3,4,5},{10,20,30,40,50}} `
