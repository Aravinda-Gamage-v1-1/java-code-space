### Java Conditions and If Statements
* You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

1. Less than: a < b
2. Less than or equal to: a <= b
3. Greater than: a > b
4. Greater than or equal to: a >= b
5. Equal to a == b
6. Not Equal to: a != b

- You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

#### Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

#### Else
* Use else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

#### Else if
* Use else if statement to specify a new condition if the condition is false.

#### Short hand if else
* There also a short hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of the code with single line, and is must often used to replace simple if else statements.
