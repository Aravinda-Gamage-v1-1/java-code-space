### Java Conditions and If Statements
* You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

1. Less than: a < b
2. Less than or equal to: a <= b
3. Greater than: a > b
4. Greater than or equal to: a >= b
5. Equal to a == b
6. Not Equal to: a != b

- You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

#### Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
