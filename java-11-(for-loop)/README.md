### For Loop
* When you know exactly how many times you wants to loop through a block of code, use for loop instead of a while loop. 

### Nested Loops
* It is possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a nested loop.
* The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop".

### For Each loop
* There is also "for each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array.
