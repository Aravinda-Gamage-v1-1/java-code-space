### Java Output / Print

#### println()
``` System.out.println("Hello java world") ```

* Text must be wrapped inside double quotation marks.

#### print()
``` System.out.print("Hello Java world") ```

* There is also a print() method, which is similar to println()
* The only different is that it does not insert new line at the end of the output.

#### Print Numbers
``` System.out.println(12334455) ```

* You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
* But don't put numbers inside double quotation marks.

* You can also perform mathematical operations inside the println() method.

``` System.out.println(10 + 20) ```
``` System.out.println(30 - 20) ```
``` System.out.println(30 * 20) ```
``` System.out.println(30 / 20) ```

### Java Comment

#### Single line comment
* Single line comment start with two forward slashes (//).
``` // This is a comment ```

#### Multi line comment
* Multi line comment start with /* and ends with */ 
``` /* This is a multi line comment */ ```
