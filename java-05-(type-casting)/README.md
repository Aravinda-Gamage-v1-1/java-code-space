### Java type casting

* Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another data type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

1. Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

2. Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
