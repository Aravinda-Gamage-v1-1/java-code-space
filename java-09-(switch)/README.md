### Java Switch Statements
* Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

#### This is how it works
* The switch expression is evaluated once.
* The value of the expression is compared with the value of the each case.
* If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
* The break and default keywords are optional.
